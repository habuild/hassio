This [home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/) add-on provides the installation, configuration, and integration for the **Bluetooth** version of [sbfspot 3.9.5](https://github.com/SBFspot/SBFspot/releases/latest). This version is for the OS installation method of Home assistant.

This add-on installs a cron service for SPFspot uploader at 5 minutely daytime interval, [PVoutput](https://pvoutput.org/) account and API are required, it also requires an SQL database like Mariadb.
It also sends a MQTT message to home assistant, therefore a MQTT broker is required.

## Installation

### Initial database creation.

Download and import either [No Drop DB create](https://github.com/habuild/hassio-addons/blob/main/.images/CreateMySQLDB_no_drop.sql) **or** [Create My SQL.sql](https://github.com/SBFspot/SBFspot/blob/master/SBFspot/CreateMySQLDB.sql) in [phpMyAdmin](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-phpmyadmin) to create your database. **IF** you haven't already created the database previously, use the NO Drop version. You will also need to add the Database and User/Password to MariaDB and allocate the port.

### MQTT

[haos-sbfspot_sensors.yaml](https://github.com/habuild/hassio-addons/blob/main/.images/sbfspot_sensors.yaml) I use packages to include these yaml sensors. You will need to change to match your plant name and serial as you have set in the add-on configuration options.

**MQTT options argument** [configuration options](https://github.com/habuild/hassio-addons/blob/main/.images/Example_Config.yaml). The MQTT Username, and Password need to be hardcoded into the **MQTT_PublisherArgs:** The **{host}** **{topic}** and **{{message}}** will be picked up from options.

**MQTT_PublisherArgs:** **'-h {host} -u Your_MQTT_Username -P Your_MQTT_password -t {topic} -m "{{message}}" -d -r'**

**-d** is for MQTT debug in log. Which is helpful for confirming the MQTT messages are actually being sent.

**-r** is to retain messages. it is advised against using retain flag

### Example Configuration Options.

can be copy/pasted as [Example Config](https://github.com/habuild/hassio-addons/blob/main/haos-sbfspot/.images/Example_Config.yaml) or entered via UI

### Data paths

In HAOS (home assistant operating system) the /data/ path arrives at /mnt/data/supervisor/addons/data/{slug}\_haos-sbfspot on the host.

### Upload logs

Logs delete after 3 days now. You would need SSH with Root host access to find them anyway.
